cloud infrastructure cost can be broken down into following heads - storage, compute and network cost

we can optmize storage cost by following ways

    reducing the size of data
    compressing the data which cannot be removed
    removing any repeated data we are storing

we can optimise compute cost by following ways

    reducing unncessary computes,
    increasing efficiency of our application
    removing repeated computes

we can optmise cost of network by following ways

    remove repeated data transfer happening over network
    compressing the data tranferred over network
    removing unncessary data being transferred over network.

time is also a factor in reducing cost, since we have to pay for the time for which services were availed.

so in a nutshell

speed increase which leads to less time leading to less cost

size reduces leads to less time,less storage, less network leads to less cost

qty of data reduction leads to less time leads to less cost
